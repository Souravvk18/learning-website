--DOCTYPE! html:– A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag.
             The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.<br>
--html:– This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements
        within it.<br>
--head:– This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information related to the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a webpage.<br>
