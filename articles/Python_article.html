      <h1> PYTHON Article</h1>
    <br><br><h2>* Python--></h2><br>  <p>
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in datastructures, combined with
dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect
existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.  </p><br>  <p> Python supports
modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary
form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.<br><br></p>
<h2>*Python 3 basics--></h2><br>  <p>
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the early 1990s and its latest version is 3.10.4, we can simply call it as Python3. Python 3.0 was released in
2008. and is interpreted language i.e it’s not compiled and the interpreter will check the code line by line. This article can used to learn very basics of
Python programming language.<br><br>  </p>
<h2>*Python Keywords--></h2><br>  <p>
Keywords in Python are reserved words that can not be used as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier.<br><br>  </p>

<h2>*Operators--></h2><br>  <p>
Python Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables. These are standard symbols used for the purpose
of logical and arithmetic operations. In this article, we will look into different types of Python operators. <br><br>  </p>
<h2>*Taking input in Python--></h2><br>  <p>
input ( ) : <br>This function first takes the input from the user and convert it into string. Type of the returned object always will be <type ‘str’>.
                 It does not evaluate the expression it just return the complete statement as String.  <p/>  <p> <br><br>For example –
                                                                        # a use of input()<br>
                                                         val = input("Enter your value: ")<br>
                                                                          print(val)<br>  </p>
<br><br><h2>*Data Types--></h2><br>
<h3><I>1)Strings in Python-</I></h3><br>  <p>
        A string is a sequence of characters. It can be declared in python by using double-quotes. Strings are immutable, i.e., they cannot be
       changed.<br><br>  <p/>
                        <p>  # Assigning string to a variable<br>
                              a = “This is a string”<br>
                                    print (a)<br>  </p>
<br><h3><I>2)Iterations in Python-</I><br></h3>
        <p>  <br>Iterations or looping can be performed in python by ‘for’ and ‘while’ loops. Apart from iterating upon a particular condition, we can also
       iterate on strings, lists, and tuples.<br><br>  </p>
                   <p>Example : Iteration by while loop for a condition<br>
                              i = 1<br>
                       while (i < 10): print(i) i += 1 The output is : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   <br>  </p>
<br><h3><I>3)Tuples in Python-</I></h3><br>
        <p>A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are just like lists with the exception that tuples cannot be changed once declared.
     Tuples are usually faster than lists.<br><br>  </p>
                  <p>     <br> tup = (1, “a”, “string”, 1+2)<br>
                       print(tup)<br>
                      print(tup[1])<br>
                     The output is :<br>
                       (1, ‘a’, ‘string’, 3)<br>
                             a   <br>  </p>
<h2>*Operator Functions in Python--></h2>  <p>Python has predefined functions for many mathematical, logical, relational, bitwise etc operations under the module
  “operator”. Some of the basic functions are covered in this article.<br><br>  </p>
<b>1. add(a, b) :- This functions returns addition of the given arguments.<br>
Operation – a + b.<br></b>
<b>2. sub(a, b) :- This functions returns difference of the given arguments.<br>
Operation – a – b.<br></b>
<b>3. mul(a, b) :- This functions returns product of the given arguments.<br>
Operation – a * b.<br><br></b>
<h2>*Python Functions--></h2><br>  <p>Python Functions is a block of related statements designed to perform a computational, logical, or evaluative task. The idea is to put
      some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs,
      we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again. <br><br>  </p>
  <p>Functions can be both built-in or user-defined. It helps the program to be concise, non-repetitive, and organized.  </p>
<br><br>  <p>Syntax:
                  <br>   def function_name(parameters):
                      <br>      """docstring"""
                    <br>           statement(s)
                      <br>  return expression  </p>
