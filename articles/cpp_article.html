      <h1> C++ Article</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h2>*C++ Programming Language--></h2><br><p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language and is widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It has
       imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.</p><br><br>
    <h2>*Basic Syntax and First Program in C++--></h2><br><p>Learning C++ programming can be simplified into writing your program in a text editor and saving it with
      correct extension(.CPP, .C, .CP) and compiling your program using a compiler or online IDE. The “Hello World” program is the first step towards
      learning any programming language and also one of the simplest programs you will learn.</p><br><br>
    <h2>*Basic I/O in C++--></h2><br><p>C++ comes with libraries which provides us with many ways for performing input and output.</p><br><p> In C++ input and output is performed in
      the form of a sequence of bytes or more commonly known as streams. The two keywords cin and cout are used very often for taking inputs and printing
       outputs respectively. These two are the most basic methods of taking input and output in C++.</p><br><br>
  <h2>*Variables and Types in C++--></h2><br><p> A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. The value stored in a variable
      can be changed during program execution. A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory
      location. In C++, all the variables must be declared before use.<br><br></p>
  <h2>*C++ Data Types--></h2><br><p>All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. </p><br><p>Therefore, we can say that data types are
        used to tell the variables the type of data it can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable
        based on the data type with which it is declared. Every data type requires a different amount of memory.<br></p>
        <p>  Data types in C++ are mainly divided into three types:</p><br>
    <p>  1. Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int,
         char, float, bool, etc.<br></p>
      <b>  Primitive data types available in C++ are:<br>
          Integer<br>
          Character<br>
          Boolean<br>
          Floating Point<br>
          Double Floating Point<br>
          Valueless or Void<br>
          Wide Character<br></b>
    <p> 2. Derived Data Types: The data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types.</p>
    <b>  These can be of four types namely:<br>
           Function<br>
           Array<br>
           Pointer<br>
           Reference<br></b>
    <p>3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: These data types are defined by the user itself. Like, as defining a class in C++ or a structure.</p>
       <b>C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:<br>
          Class<br>
          Structure<br>
          Union<br>
          Enumeration<br>
          Typedef defined DataType<br></b>
  <h2>  *Datatype Modifiers--></h2><p>As the name implies, datatype modifiers are used with the built-in data types to modify the length of data that a particular data type
       can hold.<br><br></p>
       <b>Data type modifiers available in C++ are:<br>
       Signed<br>
       Unsigned<br>
       Short<br>
       Long<br></b>
  <h2> *Operators in C++--></h2> <br><p>Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Thus the functionality of C/C++ programming language is incomplete without the use
      of operators. We can define operators as symbols that help us to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. In other words, we can say
      that an operator operates the operands.<br></p>
   <h2>*Loops in C++--></h2><br><p> Loops in programming comes into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements. For example: Suppose we want to print “Hello World” 10 times.
      This can be done in two ways, Iterative method and by using Loops.<br></p>
  <h2> *Errors in C++--></h2><br> <p>Error is an illegal operation performed by the user which results in abnormal working of the program. Programming errors often remain undetected until the
     program is compiled or executed. Some of the errors inhibit the program from getting compiled or executed. Thus errors should be removed before compiling and executing.<br></p>
     <br>
    <h2>*Arrays in C++--></h2><br><p>An array in C/C++ or be it in any programming language is a collection of similar data items stored at contiguous memory locations and elements can be
      accessed randomly using indices of an array.  They can be used to store collection of primitive data types such as int, float, double, char, etc of any particular type.
      To add to it, an array in C/C++ can store derived data types such as the structures, pointers etc. Given below is the picture representation of an array.<br><br></p>
  <h2>*Need array--></h2><br><p>We can use normal variables (v1, v2, v3, ..) when we have a small number of objects, but if we want to store a large number of instances, it becomes difficult
     to manage them with normal variables. The idea of an array is to represent many instances in one variable.<br><br></p>
    <h2>*std::string class in C++--></h2><br><p>C++ has in its definition a way to represent a sequence of characters as an object of the class. This class is called std:: string. String class
      stores the characters as a sequence of bytes with the functionality of allowing access to the single-byte character.<br><br></p>
    <h2>*Raw String Literal in C++--></h2><br><p>A Literal is a constant variable whose value does not change during the lifetime of the program. Whereas, a raw string literal is a string in which
      the escape characters like ‘ \n, \t, or \” ‘ of C++ are not processed. Hence, a raw string literal that starts with R”( and ends in )”.<br><br></p>
  <h2>  *Functions in C++--></h2><br><p>A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output.The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task
      together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.<br><br></p>
    <h2>*Inline Functions in C++--></h2><br><p>C++ provides an inline functions to reduce the function call overhead. Inline function is a function that is expanded in line when it is called. When the
      inline function is called whole code of the inline function gets inserted or substituted at the point of inline function call. This substitution is performed by the C++ compiler at
      compile time. Inline function may increase efficiency if it is small.<br><br></p>
    <h2>*Pointers--></h2><br><p>A pointer is a variable that holds memory address of another variable. A pointer needs to be dereferenced with * operator to access the memory location it points to.</p>
    <br><br>
  <h2>  *References--> </h2><br><p>A reference variable is an alias, that is, another name for an already existing variable. A reference, like a pointer, is also implemented by storing the address of an object.
      A reference can be thought of as a constant pointer (not to be confused with a pointer to a constant value!) with automatic indirection, i.e the compiler will apply the * operator for you.</p>
