      <h1> Virtual Learning</h1>

      <p>
        During the recent Coronavirus lockdown, many businesses turned to virtual meeting software to help keep their companies running.
        Many universities will also start their new terms with online lectures, rather than in-person classrooms.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a company, we also switched to temporarily offering just online learning during the summer of 2020. It was very successful and
        so we are set to host even more kids’ virtual classrooms for the remainder of the year.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, we can see 2021 as being even bigger for online learning and anticipate hundreds of children completing our courses purely
        via virtual classroom environments.The bottom line is, virtual classrooms can work very well and are the future of learning. Online
        learning is something that kids at all stages in the education system can use, and to great effect too, and we will now discuss.
      </p>

      <h2>Greater flexibility and comfort</h2>
      <p>
        Kids can learn at their own pace with pre-recorded virtual classes, dipping in and out when it’s the best time for them.It’s also more comfortable learning from home and can be better option for children who have a physical disability where
        traditional establishments may be challenging to access.
      </p>

      <h2>Immediate feedback on learning</h2>
      <p>
        Most online learning classrooms provide the opportunity for immediate feedback as opposed to traditional
        classrooms where teachers take the work home to mark it.
      </p>

      <h2>Improved accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Virtual classrooms are accessible to any child providing they have access to a computer and stable internet connection.
        It doesn’t matter what their mobility is like, they are able to login to a virtual classroom and start learning.
        Plus, course materials for your child’s online course can be accessed at any time over the Internet, 24 hours a
        day and 365 days a year.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost savings</h2>
      <p>
        There is no need for expensive travel (or even accommodation). As well as saving travel costs, virtual classrooms will also reduce your child’s carbon footprint related to gas and fuel.Many virtual lessons and classrooms will
        often be far cheaper than a traditional establishment
        such as a college.
      </p>

      <p>
        On average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction… Virtual learning has a promising future.It has been shown already to match or exceed average student outcome expectations, and
        parents and students are signing up for virtual courses at an increasing rate.
      </p>
